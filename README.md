<h1> A simple application to help keep track of how much spent on feeding.</h1>

The rather unfortunate strike that began sometime in November 2018, was a blessing in disguise. It was to be my drive to develop an 
application for myself. And, yet the feelings associated with the strike ending was no much different from when it started 3 months ago.
I have been forced to abandon this app at this stage of completion. I had hoped that I could create a chart to show the trend of spendings,
but for the sudden end of the strike.

If you can find use of this app, do use it. I would be delighted to know you did.

<strong>Till I return, I have one last chance to excel as an undergraduate, and I will attempt to take it.</strong>
